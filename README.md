## <b>Reflections:</b>

<p>This was a take-home challenge to simulate what it's like applying for a job in the "Real World". We were tasked to only give ourselves 8 working hours to complete this challenge. It was a great run-through of what it'll be like while applying. The stress is real, because you're given a time-frame to complete, and you want to complete it to the best of your ability.
All in all, this was a great first experience and I'm grateful for the challenge.</p>
